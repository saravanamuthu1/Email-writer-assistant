# Email Generator Assistant

The **Email Generator Assistant** is a service that generates email replies using the Gemini 1.5 AI model.

## Overview

This project is a Spring Boot-based service that integrates with the **Gemini API** to generate email replies. It allows users to submit an email and receive a generated reply based on a specific tone. The service is designed to be easily extended or integrated into larger systems requiring automated email responses.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the service, make sure you have the following:

- **Java 11 or later**: The project is built using Spring Boot, and Java 11 is the minimum required version.
- **Maven**: For building the project and handling dependencies.
- **Gemini API key**: You will need an API key for the Gemini 1.5 model.

2. **Build the project**:

   If you donâ€™t have Maven installed globally, you can run it through the Maven wrapper:

    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

   This will compile and build the application.

3. **Run the service**:

## Configuration

1. **Configure API URL and Key**:

   The `EmailGeneratorService` communicates with the Gemini API using the following properties:

    - `gemini.api.url`: The base URL for the Gemini API (e.g., `https://api.gemini.com`).
    - `gemini.api.key`: The API key for authenticating with the Gemini API.

   You can configure these properties by adding them to your `application.properties` file:

   ```properties
   gemini.api.url=https://api.gemini.com
   gemini.api.key=your-api-key-here
